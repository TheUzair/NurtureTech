4. **Start the backend server**:

```bash
cd backend_node
npm start
```

5. **Start the frontend client**:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## File Structure

### Backend
- **config/**: Configuration files for database and environment setup.
- **controllers/**: Logic for each API endpoint.
- **middleware/**: Authentication, validation, and CORS handling.
- **models/**: Database schemas using ORM (e.g., Sequelize).
- **app.js**: Main backend entry point.

### Frontend
- **public/**: Static assets and translation files.
- **src/**: React components, context, and styling.
  - **components/**: Individual React components.
  - **context/**: Global state management with context providers.
  - **pages/**: Main page components.
  - **App.jsx**: Routing and context integration.
  - **index.jsx**: Entry point for React.

---

## Real-time Updates

Socket.IO is used to push updates in real-time for:
- Children data
- Caregivers data
- Finances
- Attendance
- Enrollments

This ensures consistent and up-to-date information across all clients.

---

## Caching

Redis Cloud optimizes performance by caching frequently accessed data such as:
- Attendance records
- Caregiver details
- Child profiles

This reduces MySQL load and enhances application scalability.

---

## Error Handling

Custom middleware catches and formats errors, returning standardized responses for better debugging and user experience.

## Enhancements
- **Internationalization (i18n)**:
  - The application supports **English** (default), **Hindi**, and **French** for a localized user experience.
  - Language preferences are stored persistently using local storage, ensuring the user's choice is remembered across sessions.
  - Translation files are managed dynamically under the `public/locales` directory for efficient scalability.

- **Light/Dark Theme Preferences**:
  - Integrated a responsive **theme switcher** that allows users to choose between **light** and **dark** modes.
  - The selected theme is applied instantly across the application and saved in local storage for persistent preferences.
  - Built using Tailwind CSS for seamless theme transitions.

- Integrated **Google Cloud SQL** for scalable and secure database management.
- Migrated Redis caching to **Redis Cloud** for better performance and reliability.
- Deployed backend and frontend with **Render**.
- Enhanced real-time updates with **Socket.IO** using Redis Pub/Sub.
- Implemented robust CORS policies for secure frontend-backend communication.

## Upcoming Features

- **Detailed API Documentation**:  
  Comprehensive documentation for all endpoints, including request parameters, response formats, and example use cases. This will include:  
  - Authentication endpoints (e.g., login, register).  
  - CRUD operations for managing attendance, caregivers, children, enrollments, and finances.  
  - Real-time communication endpoints for Socket.IO events.  
  - Caching strategies with Redis for frequently accessed data.

## Future Plans

1. **Multi-tenancy Support**:  
   - Allow multiple childcare centers or schools to use the application with separate data and configurations.  
   - Custom branding for each tenant (e.g., logos, themes).  
   - Role-based access control for tenant-specific admin and staff users.

2. **Advanced Analytics Dashboards**:  
   - Visualize key metrics like attendance trends, caregiver performance, financial summaries, and enrollment statistics.  
   - Export data as PDF/CSV reports for offline use.  
   - Interactive charts and graphs powered by libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.  

3. **Localization Enhancements**:  
   - Expand language support beyond English, Hindi, and French to include other widely spoken languages.  
   - Implement **date, currency, and number formats** specific to user-selected locales.  

4. **AI-Powered Insights**:  
   - Leverage AI for predictive analytics, such as forecasting enrollment trends or identifying patterns in attendance.  
   - Generate actionable insights, like suggestions for optimizing staffing based on historical data.  

5. **Mobile App Integration**:  
   - Develop native or hybrid mobile apps to complement the web platform, offering on-the-go access for parents and caregivers.  
   - Push notifications for attendance alerts, upcoming payments, or new announcements.

6. **User Feedback and Support System**:  
   - Integrate a built-in feedback mechanism for users to submit bugs or feature requests directly within the app.  
   - Live chat or chatbot support to address user queries in real-time.  

7. **Offline Mode with Sync Capabilities**:  
   - Enable the application to work offline, with changes synced to the server when the user reconnects.  
   - Ideal for areas with intermittent internet connectivity.

8. **Customizable Workflows**:  
   - Allow administrators to configure workflows for attendance, payment reminders, or caregiver assignments to suit their organizationâ€™s needs.  

9. **Data Privacy and Compliance**:  
   - Ensure adherence to data protection laws like GDPR, CCPA, or local regulations.  
   - Regular audits to ensure the application meets security and privacy standards.  

10. **Integrations with Third-party Tools**:  
    - Integration with payment gateways for streamlined financial transactions.  
    - Connect with calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar) to manage caregiver schedules or events.  
    - API connectors for exporting data to third-party applications like accounting software.
